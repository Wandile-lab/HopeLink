# HopeLink: AI-Powered Disaster Response & Coordination Platform

SDG Focus: SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)

 Live Demo: https://wandile-lab.github.io/HopeLink/

# Overview
Disasters create chaos—delayed aid, overwhelmed shelters, and fragmented data lead to confusion and vulnerability. HopeLink is an AI-enhanced platform that centralizes disaster response, providing real-time coordination tools, intelligent predictions, and accessible support interfaces for affected communities and responders.

# SDG Alignment
SDG 11: Promote sustainable and resilient cities through disaster preparedness

SDG 13: Strengthen climate resilience and adaptive capabilities using AI

# AI & Engineering Approach
Core Features
Real-time disaster reporting(Mock)

AI-powered predictions for floods and fires (using placeholder ML logic)

Interactive map with:

Live shelter markers

Simulated danger zones

Optimal evacuation routes

# Backend logic to simulate AI-based aid prioritization

Technical Stack
Frontend: React, Leaflet, MUI, Recharts

Backend: FastAPI (modular APIs)

AI Modules: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn (placeholder simulations)

Mapping & Routing: OpenStreetMap (via Leaflet)

# Engineering Highlights
Automation: Dynamic form intake and aid simulation

Scalability: Micro-modular backend and UI components

Testing: Form validation and logic testing

# Data Sources
Simulated disaster datasets

OpenStreetMap (for shelter and geolocation)

Public emergency APIs (planned integration)

# Deliverables
Codebase: Modular frontend/backend with reusable components

Deployment: Live web prototype with interactive UI

Documentation: Architecture, SDG justification, AI ethics report

# Ethical & Sustainability Practices
Bias Mitigation: Simulated ML includes diverse test cases

Eco-efficiency: Lightweight rendering for low-resource environments

Accessibility: Mobile-friendly design for users in disaster conditions

## Note
- This is a demo with dummy data for development and testing.
