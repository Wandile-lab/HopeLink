# HopeLink: AI-Powered Disaster Response & Coordination Platform (SDG 11 & 13)


# SDG Focus
Goals:
SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 13 – Climate Action

Problem:
Disasters often create chaos—delayed aid, overwhelmed shelters, and lack of situational awareness. Civilians are left vulnerable, and emergency services face fragmented data. HopeLink aims to centralize crisis coordination using smart tools and predictive insights.

# AI Approach
Software Engineering Skills Applied:

Automation: Dynamic emergency form intake; aid allocation simulations.

Testing: Component testing (e.g., form validation, prediction logic).

Scalability: Micro-modules for map rendering, AI logic, and form submissions.

Technical Solution:

Real-time disaster reports via user-friendly forms

AI-generated predictions (placeholder ML models) for floods and fires

Live map with shelter markers, danger zones, and optimal evacuation routes

Backend logic to simulate AI-based aid prioritization

# Tools & Frameworks
AI/ML:

TensorFlow (placeholder ML logic)

Scikit-learn (simulation-ready prediction models)

Software Engineering:

Python, JavaScript

Git, CI/CD

Data Sources:

Simulated disaster datasets

OpenStreetMap for shelter and route data

Public emergency APIs (future integrations)

# Deliverables
Code: Modular scripts for form handling, prediction engine, and dashboard logic

Deployment: Web prototype with dynamic UI and interactive map

Report: Breakdown of system architecture, SDG alignment, and ethical concerns

# Ethical & Sustainability Checks
Bias Mitigation: Ensure ML predictions are trained on diverse, inclusive data

Environmental Impact: Lightweight models and map rendering to reduce energy use

Accessibility: Mobile-responsive design for disaster-struck areas with limited access

## Note
- This is a demo with dummy data for development and testing.
