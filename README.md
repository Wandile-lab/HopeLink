# HopeLink: AI-Powered Disaster Response & Coordination Platform

SDG Focus: SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities & Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action)

 Live Demo: https://wandile-lab.github.io/HopeLink/

# Overview
Disasters create chaos—delayed aid, overwhelmed shelters, and fragmented data lead to confusion and vulnerability. HopeLink is an AI-enhanced platform that centralizes disaster response, providing real-time coordination tools, intelligent predictions, and accessible support interfaces for affected communities and responders.

> # Note(AI integration)
> 
> As of 29/07/2025 The backend has been rebuilt and now includes a working AI pipeline for disaster classification.
> 
> While the system is functional, some issues remain. Here's the current state:
> 
> AI pipeline trained and saved using joblib
> Text classification (disaster type and urgency) using predict_proba
> FastAPI backend with real, testable endpoints
> Modular structure for model reuse and separation of concerns
> 
> ⚠️ Minor issues with fallback message logic and model file loading paths
> 
> ⚠️ Model trained on small sample data — not yet optimized for large-scale accuracy (MVP status)

# SDG Alignment

SDG 3: Ensure access to emergency health services and mental health support during and after disasters through coordinated AI-assisted triaging and resource tracking

SDG 11: Promote sustainable and resilient cities through disaster preparedness

SDG 13: Strengthen climate resilience and adaptive capabilities using AI

# AI & Engineering Approach
